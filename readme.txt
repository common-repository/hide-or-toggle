Hide or Toggle plugin is a WordPress plugin that creates several blocks and replaces and improves over Itm Simple Hide as a WordPress Block. Itm Simple Hide still works but probably will not be updated any more. 

== Description ==

Currently there are two blocks.

= Simple Hide block =

Simple Hide block is a simple, easy and useful block that places a title and an open icon. 
The following paragraph or content is hidden until the user clicks the open icon.
It uses  an open icon (+) to show the paragraph content following the title. 
A close icon appears (-). Then, you can use a close icon to hide the paragraph content following the title.

= Simple Toggle block =

Simple Toggle is the same block without icons.
Just click on the first paragraph to toggle the second paragraph. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/itm-simple-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use it as a list of questions and answers? =
Yes. Just insert the block again or just duplicate it. Each block looks as an item. It's not really an Html list but a succession of blocks in the same page.

= How can I style the title and content? =
Currently has Default, Compact and Expanded style with some background changes and different padding and margin. 

= Can I change text or background color?
Yes, you can pick a different color for text or background for each block.
Or leave as it is, with defaults to theme colors.

= What if I need more styling ? =
We may add some settings to change padding and margin values or to choose a different opening and closing icons. 
We do not have a dealine yet and we want to keep it simple!.

= What resources uses? =
In addition to block editors and wp components uses the wp dashicons library and a very small jQuery javascript file.
